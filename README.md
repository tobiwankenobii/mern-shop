# MERN Shop

## eCommerce built with MERN Stack

Simple shop made using React on the Frontend, Express on the Backend and MongoDB as the Database. <br>
Pretty straightforward, probably with tons of bad practices, but this was my first that practical dive into the React & Redux.

## Getting started:

Quick note

```powershell
work-in --progress
```

Build compose images

```powershell
docker-compose build
```

Create compose containers

```powershell
docker-compose up
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable name    | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| NODE_ENV         |       |
| PORT             |       |
| MONGO_URL        |       |
| JWT_SECRET       |       |
